# Global-Health-Statistics-Dashboard Power-Bi Project

This Power BI project presents a comprehensive **Global Health Statistics Dashboard**, which provides insights into worldwide health data, including disease prevalence, affected population, and recovery rates. The dashboard offers an interactive and visually appealing representation of key global health metrics.
## Features and Visualizations

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- **Total Population Affected:** Displays the number of people impacted by various diseases.
- **Count of Doctors per 1000 People:** Highlights the availability of healthcare professionals.
- **Average Recovery Rate (%):** Indicates the percentage of people who recover from diseases.
- **Average Incidence Rate (%):** Shows how frequently new cases occur.

### 2. Prevalence Rate by Disease Category:
A pie chart categorizing different diseases such as neurological, cardiovascular, autoimmune, bacterial, viral, and more.

### 3. Total Population Affected and Prevalence by Year:
A line and area chart visualizing the trend of the affected population over time from 2000 to the present.

### 4. Total Population Affected by Disease and Treatment Type:
A donut chart that displays how diseases are treated, including **Surgery, Therapy, Vaccination, and Medication**.

### 5. Population Affected by Disease Category:
A treemap visualization that groups affected populations by disease type for quick insights.

### 6. Count of Affected People by Year:
A combined bar and line chart showing the yearly trend of affected individuals.

### 7. Geographical Impact (Total Population Affected by Country):
A gauge chart showing the total number of affected people (in billions) and highlighting **country-specific** statistics.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and dashboard development.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Handled within Power BI using **Power Query**.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Utilized for creating calculated measures and enhancing data insights.

## Insights & Use Cases
- Helps policymakers and healthcare organizations analyze disease prevalence.
- Assists researchers in tracking trends of global health conditions.
- Enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions regarding healthcare infrastructure and treatment plans.
